/* Creating a table

We can create a table by using the clause 'CREATE TABLE', pretty straight forward syntax to
remember. 

The syntax for this would be:

CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_1 data_type,
    column_2 data_type,
    column_3 data_type
)

In the example below we are going to create an example table using SQL.
*/

CREATE TABLE person (
    name TEXT,
    age INTEGER,
);



/* Inserting data into a table

We can now use the 'INSERT' clause to insert a new row into a table.

The syntax for this would be:

INSERT INTO table_name (column_1, column_2, column_3)
VALUES (column_1_data, column_2_data, column_3_data);

In the example below we will insert two rows.
*/

INSERT INTO person (name, age)
VALUES ('Tom', 18);

INSERT INTO person (name, age)
VALUES ('Kevin', 22);



/* Selecting data from a database

We can now use 'SELECT' statements to fetch data from a database. Select statements
always return a new table called the 'result set'.

The syntax for this would be:

SELECT column_name FROM table_name; -- Selects all data from a specific column of a database
SELECT * FROM table_name; -- Selects all data from the database

In the example below we will select the name and then all the data.
*/

SELECT name FROM person; -- Selecting just the names.
SELECT * FROM person; -- Selecting all the data



/* Adding new columns to tables

If we wanted to add a new column to a table we can use the 'ALTER TABLE' clause.

The syntax for this would be:

ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN column_name data_type;

In the example below we are going to add two more columns, nickname and birth year.
*/

ALTER TABLE person
ADD COLUMN nickname TEXT;

ALTER TABLE person
ADD COLUMN birth_year INTEGER;



/* Updating data in a table

If we wanted to update the data in a row we can use the 'UPDATE' clause.

The syntax for this would be:

UPDATE table_name
SET column_name = data
WHERE column_name = 'Something';

In the example below we are going update both the 'nickname' and the 'birth_year' for
'Tom' but we will only update the 'nickname' for 'Kevin'
*/

UPDATE person
SET nickname = 'Exxon'
WHERE name = 'Tom';

UPDATE person
SET birth_year = 1923
WHERE name = 'Tom';



/* Deleting data from a table

If we wanted to delete data from a table we can use the 'DELETE' clause.

The syntax for this would be:

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;

or

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE column_name = 'Something';

In the example below we will delete both if birth-year is null.
*/


DELETE FROM person
WHERE birth_year IS NULL;
