x = 3
y = 5

x = y # Means the value of x is equal to y (Assignment, 5)
x += y # Means the value of x is x + y (Addition Assignment, 8)
x -= y # Means the value of x is x - y (Subtraction Assignment, -2)
x *= y # Means the value of x is x * y (Multiplication Assignment, 15)
x /= y # Means the value of x is x / y (Division Assignment, 0.6)
x %= y # Means the value of x is the remainder of x divided by y (Modulus Assignment, 3)
x //= y # Means the value of x is the largest integer less than or equal to the normal division result of x divided by y (Floor Division Assignment, 0)
x **= y # Means the value of x is the value of x raised by the power of y (Exponentiation Assignment, 243)
x &= y # Means 
x |= y #
