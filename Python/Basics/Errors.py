"""
There is a few different types of errors you may encounter when writing Python. Below
are a list of some of the most common errors.

Documentation - https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/exceptions


SyntaxError:
This means there is something wrong with the way your program is written. Punctuation that 
does not belong, a command where iti s not expected, or a missing paranthesis can all trigger
this type of error.

NameError:
This occurs when the Python interpreter sees a word it does not recognize. Code that contains
something that looks like a variable but was never defined will throw a NameError.
