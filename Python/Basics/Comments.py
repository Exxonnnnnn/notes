""" 
In Python there is one main way to do comments. That is by using the
"#" symbol. Using this will create a single line comment. 

There isn't really an official way to do multi-line comments in Python 
but as you can see by this one, you can do it by putting it in three 
double quotes. When you do this Python will read the string but then
ignore it, as long as it is not assigned to a variable.

You can view a few examples below.
