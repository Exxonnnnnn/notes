""" 
When creating new variables in Python you do not need to use a command/keyword.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. You can
also change the type and the value of a variable after it has been set.

Documentation - https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp

In the example below we are going to create two variables, "myName" and "myAge".
We will then re-assign the value of these variables.
"""

myName = "Exxon"
myAge = 18

print(myName) # This will log - Exxon
print(myAge) # This will log - 18

myName = "Tom"
myAge = "19" 

print(myName) # This will log - Tom
print(myAge) # This will log - 19

# Notice how you do not get any errors by reassigning the value or the type of the variable.
