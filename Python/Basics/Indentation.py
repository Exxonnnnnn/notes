"""
Python Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. 
In Python, indentation is used to indicate a block of code. For example, 
if we were to do an if statement then we would need to use indentation 
to show what to do after the if statement. If you incorrectly use indentation
then you may get an "IndentationError".

Documentation - https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_syntax.asp

In the example below we will have a simple if statement. If we were to skip the
indentation then we would get a Syntax Error.

if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!") # We have used indentation to show what it should do if the if statement is true
